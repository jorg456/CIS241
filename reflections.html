		<p>I remember when I first started, I would have trouble figuring out how to open an html file and I remeber sitting at my table trying to find the run button on VSCode. I then searched online and finally figured it out. I also remeber having trouble linking my CSS file back when I started since I was still new to incorperating different languages into another. Anyway, for this class I would say that it was very helpful in my understanding of HTML, while I have worked with HTML before, this class has helped refine and solve any confusion that I had before. What I liked about this class was the how in depth each week was on a certain topic and even going in depth such as finding the different video control and picture formats that would allow for transparent backgrounds.</p>
