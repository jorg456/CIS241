		<h3>Bikes or Bikes</h3>
		<p>I'd say that I've ridden bicycles for most of my life and the time that I figured out that I was really interests in 2 wheeled vehicles was in my junior year of highschool. One of my friends got me into riding road bikes, and invited me to do a bit of trail riding along with another friend. We tried our best to go as far as we could while also reserving some strength to make it back home. After that day, the three of us  had a competitive spririt in trying to see who was faster. As time went on, we got faster and had more endurance to travel even further. My furthest was going from Lynnwood down to Issaquah which took about 8 hours. <br> Only problem now was the inconvenince of riding a bicycle everywhere since speed was limited to only how much my body could put out. Cars seemed a bit too boring and so a good comprimise was motorcycles. My dad had already had one and so I began to practice on it and later got my license to ride. Ever since, I took on more interests in motorcycles and it became my main one.</p>
