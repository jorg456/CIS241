		<p class="aboutme"> This is my portfolio and you can access my other links as well. I am currently taking classes at both UW and Edmonds College. I am taking this class to complete a Full Stack Developer Ceriticate. I currently work as a Lifeguard at an indoor pool. I enjoy riding bicycles, play video games, swim, play badminton, and ride motorcycles.<br> Taking this class has helped me improve my HTML and CSS skills and I can say with confidence that it will help me in the future. I plan to become a CS major at UW and have some internship experience already with Tmobile. My internship has allowed me to try out many different programming languages and work with front and back end languages which have been very help to expose me to what is used in the real world.</p>
