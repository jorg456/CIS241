    <div >
      <p >I did have my sights set on T-Mobile since I have
        prior experience with them and overall I liked the work enviroment. They
        have a hybrid work week meaning that you would need to come in the
        office at least 3 times a week and other days you can stay at home to
        work. I also enjoyed the teams that I worked with since we worked fairly
        well together. I worked with programming languages such as HTML, CSS
        Javascript, Python and SQL. While most of the work that I did was front
        end, I did dive a little into the back end and while I do want to gain
        more experience in back end, I would be more experienced in front end.</p>
